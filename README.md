A library for the management of geographic coordinates.

## About
This library provides a simple way to manipulate geographic coordinates while maintaining consistent values. Two coordinates systems are available: the [geographic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system), which is made up of latitude, longitude, and altitude. And the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), which is the regular one for representing arbitrary points in a three-dimensional space. Both of them can be converted from one to the other without restrictions but assuming a precision error, given the necessary operations for the conversion.
